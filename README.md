# LLM-Based Email Summarization and Response Generation

This project implements an LLM-powered email assistant designed to help users efficiently understand and respond to long or complex emails. It combines email summarization with controlled response generation, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adherence to user-defined constraints. The system is built using LangChain and integrates Meta LLaMA 3.1 via the Groq API for fast, high-quality natural language processing.
